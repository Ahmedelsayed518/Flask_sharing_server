# Flask_sharing_server
Flask server sharing any directory to localhost and to your network

# FlaskServer.py
* it takes two arguements:
    1. port.
    2. the path to the directory to share.

* all arguements has defaults as follows:
    -   port -> 5000.
    -   path -> the current path you are in in your terminal.

# FlaskServer_exe.py
* it's a GUI app takes also two arguements but in gui not the command line
* feel free to convert it to exe it will work.

# TODO:
* as you can see my styling is not good at all so i am gonna learn some css and update.
